# tic-tac-toe: lists tutorial

# tip: break down a project into small pieces to work on

# note: how do we visualize the game itself?
#       how do we know if we scored? 
#       what will be our values?


game = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]

# a basic for loop always prints out items in a list line by line instead of all in one line
for row in game:
    print(row)
